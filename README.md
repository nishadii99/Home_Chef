# 🍳 HOME CHEF BUY & SELL PLATFORM

## 📝 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is my **Semester 2 Final Project** – a full-stack web-based food ordering and management system.  
The platform enables **Customers**, **Chefs/Publishers**, and **Admins** to interact with the system in different ways.

- **Customers** can browse meals, add them to the cart, place orders, view order history, and receive real-time order confirmation emails.
- **Chefs / Publishers** can create and manage their dishes, update prices, and view order analytics.
- **Admins** can manage users, menu items, chefs, and all orders while monitoring system activities.

The platform integrates third-party APIs such as **FreeImage** for image hosting and **PayHere** for handling payments.
